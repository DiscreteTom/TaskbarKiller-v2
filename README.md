# TaskbarKiller-v2

No GUI, simpler than [TaskbarKiller](https://github.com/DiscreteTom/TaskBarKiller).

## Usage

First, turn on **Auto-hide the taskbar** in system settings.

Press `Win`+`~` to hide windows taskbar, press again to show it back.

No GUI, so you have to use Windows Task Manager to kill this process.

## Build

MSVC(Visual Studio 2017)
